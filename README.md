# Possible BottleNecks:
A user can favorite an idea more than once --> This will not happen untill the frontend lets. ( can be taken care in frontend ).

While making request to all the favories of all the users in the service , this may over-load the database if the users & ideas are huge. ( consider like a million)

--> This can be taken care by increasng the power of machine running the Database.

--> Limit the number of users & ideas comming from the request. ( Hard to get all the favories of all the users in the service )
